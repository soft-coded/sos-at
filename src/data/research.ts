		title: "Low Productivity and Profitability",
		content:
			"During the Green Revolution, India’s food production rose drastically, from 65 million tonnes (MT) to 110 MT, largely due to heavy use of fertilisers/nutrients, in addition to the use of high-yielding variety seeds and expansion in irrigation areas. Fertilisers would again play a key role in enhancing productivity, provided we stop unscientific use of fertilisers being adopted. To explain the point, it is observed that farmers are now using more urea as compared to phosphorus and potash carrying fertilisers. This is due to the recent government policies that have led to distortions in prices and hence in the use of nutrients. Indian soils are also deficient in micro-nutrients organic carbon. We need to implement the government’s policy of integrated nutrient management to increase productivity."

			"In a land where roughly 70% of the population resides in rural areas and half of the nation’s population farms for a living, the importance of India’s agricultural sector cannot be overstated. Despite these massive numbers, the country’s agricultural output has been unable to keep pace with growing demands and global competition. According to the World Bank, “India’s rice yields are one-third of China’s and about half of those in Vietnam and Indonesia. With the exception of sugarcane, potato and tea, the same is true for most other agricultural commodities.”In India, the infrastructure connecting these partners is very weak. Each stakeholder: farmers, wholesalers, food manufacturers, retailers all work in silos."

Each stakeholder: farmers, wholesalers, food manufacturers, retailers all work in silos. Also, demand forecasting is totally absent and the farmers try to push what they produce in to the market. Data integration, financial flow management, supply-demand matching, collaborative forecasting, information sharing, goods movement synchronization through efficient transport scheduling, are very well practised in high technology industries with immense benefits."

			"By 2050, the world will have nine billion mouths to feed. Facing drought, floods and changing rainfall patterns, dishing up enough servings to meet growing demand will become increasingly challenging. A report from the UN's intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), released in March found climate change is already cutting into the global food supply and could lead to dramatic drops in global wheat and maize production. Fish too will take a hit, with catches in some areas of the tropics estimated to fall between 40% and 60%."

		title: "Farmers' Plight",
		content:
			"Historically India is an agrarian society. When the colonial powers controlled the country they exploited our farmers for their economical benefits. Such as cultivating raw materials for their industrial use one such example is indigo production. India has a lot of landless farmers or farmers who has less amount of land holding. For the less amount of land he can't invest in tractors or any there technology so he still follows subsistence form of agriculture. Proper irrigation facilities: our country is a monsoonal country, that is majority of our water needs depend on the monsoon. In north and north east states the perennial​ rivers are there for water requirements but the south states are mainly dependant on monsoon. Nowadays monsoon failure seems to be usual one so lots of farmers lose their income."
